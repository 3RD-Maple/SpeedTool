# Contributing

Thank you very much for showing interest in improving the SpeedTool project!  
We value and encourage all kinds of contributions, from bug reports and feature suggestions to pull requests. To speed up and ease the contribution process, please refer to the following ideas.

## Issues

Feel free to add anything to the Issues section of this repo. Bug reports, feature request, improvement ideas, or discussion points.  

## Code
Please, keep code contributions as small as possible. It is difficult to review and merge big changes spanning over several files / systems.  
If a big change is necessary, it's best to either discuss it first, or break it up in smaller contributions spanning over multiple PRs.  
It would be very appreciated if by the end of a PR it could be squashed and rebased on top of `master` branch with a single commit!

We welcome refactorings as long as they are meaningful and help improve the codebase.

### Code style
There isn't any specific code-style imposed.  
**When formatting code, just try to follow the code around your contribution**

### No-go's

These are the kind of things that are unlikely to be merged:
* PRs with several hundred lines of code changed, spanning over several systems/files
* Formatting/whitespace fixes
* **PRs that add dependenices**
